We're currently working on lots of things! Please take a short moment fill out our [survey](https://unitysoftware.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0ojVkDVW0nNrHkW) to help us identify what products and packages to build next.

## Installation

1. Using Unity 2020.2 or later, open the Package Manager from `Window` -> `Package Manager`.
2. In the Package Manager window, find and click the + button in the upper lefthand corner of the window. Select `Add package from git URL....`

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29758400/110989310-8ea36180-8326-11eb-8318-f67ee200a23d.png)

3. Enter the git URL for the desired package. Note: you can append a version tag to the end of the git url, like `#v0.4.0` or `#v0.5.0`, to declare a specific package version, or exclude the tag to get the latest from the package's `main` branch.

    ```
    https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/VHACD.git?path=/com.unity.robotics.vhacd#mesh-generator
    ```
4. Click `Add`.

To install from a local clone of the repository, see [installing a local package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html) in the Unity manual.

## Mesh Decomposer Tool Usage

1. If you are in Play mode, exit Play mode.
2. To start, go to the top-level menu bar and select `VHACD > Generate Collider Meshes`.
1. In the new `VHACD Generation Settings` window that appears, select a `Generation Mode`.
   1. `Single Mode` allows you to select one prefab or FBX file to import into the scene and fine-tune the parameters before saving the file.
   2. `Batch Mode` allows you to select a directory and convert all prefabs or FBX files found inside to have newly generated colliders.
2. Select a file or directory to convert. 
   1. In `Batch Mode`, select if you want to apply changes to all prefabs or FBX files.
3. Select a `Mesh Save Path` for the meshes that will be generated by the tool. By default, this will create a directory in your selected folder, `/VHACD/Meshes`.
4. Where applicable, update the following:
   1. `Overwrite any existing collider components?`: If this is *on*, any existing mesh collider will be removed and replaced with the newly generated ones.
   2. `Overwrite existing assets?`: In case a prefab is selected, when this is *on*, this will automatically overwrite the same prefab asset. If this is *off*, you can select a different directory to save the new prefabs to.
5. You can modify the VHACD parameters for the generation process as desired.
6. Generation step:
   1. In `Single Mode`:
      1. You can now `Import Mesh` to add the mesh into your scene for preview purposes.
      2. Once imported, you can select `Generate!` to generate mesh colliders for the imported object with the given VHACD parameters. Note the Scene View updates as the colliders are added.
      3. You can now modify the parameters and regenerate, `Save` the new prefab (which will open a save file panel), or `Reset Object`, which will undo your recent generation and remove the preview object from the scene.
   2. In `Batch Mode`:
      1. You can preview how many assets are found below the VHACD parameters, next to `Assets found in directory`. You can now click `Generate!` to iterate through the assets and generate new collider meshes. Note the Scene View updates as the colliders are added for each object. Also note that a progress bar in the Editor Window will display how many assets remain to be converted.
      2. When the generation is done, the progress bar will disappear and the preview objects will be removed from the scene.

# The V-HACD library decomposes a 3D surface into a set of "near" convex parts.

![Approximate convex decomposition of "Camel"](https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd/raw/master/doc/acd.png)

# Why do we need approximate convex decomposition?

Collision detection is essential for [realistic physical interactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyjE5L4-1lQ) in video games and computer animation. In order to ensure real-time interactivity with the player/user, video game and 3D modeling software developers usually approximate the 3D models composing the scene (e.g. animated characters, static objects...) by a set of simple convex shapes such as ellipsoids, capsules or convex-hulls. In practice, these simple shapes provide poor approximations for concave surfaces and generate false collision detection.

![Convex-hull vs. ACD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmammou/v-hacd/master/doc/chvsacd.png)

A second approach consists in computing an exact convex decomposition of a surface S, which consists in partitioning it into a minimal set of convex sub-surfaces. Exact convex decomposition algorithms are NP-hard and non-practical since they produce a high number of clusters. To overcome these limitations, the exact convexity constraint is relaxed and an approximate convex decomposition of S is instead computed. Here, the goal is to determine a partition of the mesh triangles with a minimal number of clusters, while ensuring that each cluster has a concavity lower than a user defined threshold.
